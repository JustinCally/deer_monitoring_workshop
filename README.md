# ARI: Deer Monitoring Workshop

This repository contains example data and code to analyse two types of deer monitoring data:

1.  Transect data (such as pellets, rubbings, footprints)

2.  Camera trap data, which may be analysed using relative abundance or absolute abundance approaches (e.g. Camera Trap Distance Sampling)
